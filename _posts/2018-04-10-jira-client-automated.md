My old CPAN module for automating JIRA workflows too complex even for JIRA's website, JIRA::Client::Automated, has been updated to version 1.7. The change is minor -- fixing a couple of bugs and updating the links to match the new JIRA documentation website. However it's still a useful module and is being used by several companies to make their JIRA lives easier.
