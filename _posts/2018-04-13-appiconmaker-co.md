I just have to say, after deciding to make an app for the iOS App Store, the one thing I *don't* worry about is how
I'm going to make the 30 different sizes of my app's icon. That's because [App Icon Maker](http://appiconmaker.co)
is available. It's free, it's super easy, it has a good privacy policy, and it'll take a 1024x1024 icon PNG and
generate all the rest of the sizes from it perfectly.

They are awesome. Go click on one of their ads to help them keep this fantastic service running.
