## Make old-school RPG hex maps

Easily make and print old-school style role-playing game hex maps!

Hex Map Maker is designed to make maps similar to those from the old Dungeons & Dragons® Expert set for use in pen and paper role-playing games. Use the symbol picker on the left to choose a symbol and then tap on the hexes to see your map take shape. Make a mistake? Just pick a different symbol and tap the hexes to change. 

Change hex types or map size without losing your current map! (Though it will look a little different as the rows and columns move around.)

## Features:
* Choose from either pointy-top or flat-top hexes.
* Make maps of any size by choosing the number of rows and columns from the menu.
* Seven symbols to choose from: Mountains, Hills, Forest, Desert, Grassland, Water, and Blank.
* Pinch and zoom or pan with two fingers to see the whole map or zoom in to focus on details.
* Print whatever is on the screen -- so you can print the whole map or just a small portion.
* Save your maps to local storage so you can carry your entire campaign in your pocket.
* Print the map and then draw cities, roads, dungeons, rivers or anything else you need on it -- your imagination is the limit.
