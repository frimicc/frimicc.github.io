title: About
---

I am an experienced system developer with over a decade of senior-level
analysis, design, and implementation experience with complex systems.
Always learning, my current chapter is as an iOS developer. My goal is to
continue to learn and to design and develop systems and apps that make a
difference in people's lives.

The new "full-stack" is native apps + REST APIs. I make iOS
apps and REST back end services. You really need an understanding of the whole
stack to handle things like security, privacy, and performance.
