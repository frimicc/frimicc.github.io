title: About
---

I am an experienced system developer with more than a decade of senior-level
analysis, design, and implementation experience with complex systems.
I have recently hopped the fence to the front-end and am working as an iOS developer.
I'm passionate about designing and developing systems and apps that make a
difference in people's lives.

## What I Do

I write high-quality, maintainable, and testable code for a living.
I make iOS apps and REST back end services. I have an understanding of
the full stack which lets me handle things like security, privacy, and performance
that often cause trouble for front-end or mobile-only developers.
